				<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
				<p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I aim to visualize emotions dynamically, using color, intensity, and fading effects to represent their evolution over time. By incorporating a heatmap, labels, and a legend, I want to create a fluid and expressive representation of subjective experiences while ensuring past data remains visible.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Technical</strong></h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I used p5.js to create an interactive emotion-driven data visualization. Each emotion is represented by a distinct color, with intensity affecting the size of the visual elements. When an emotion is added—either through key presses or mouse clicks—it appears as a circle on the canvas. A heatmap effect is applied by layering semi-transparent colors, and a fading effect gradually reduces opacity over time while ensuring past data remains visible. Labels and a legend provide clarity, mapping colors to emotions. The canvas dynamically resizes to fit the screen, maintaining responsiveness.

				<h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The process of creating my emotion-driven data visualization in p5.js was more challenging than I expected. My goal was to represent subjective experiences in a compelling way, using color, shape, and fading effects to illustrate emotional intensity over time. I also wanted to ensure that the data persisted rather than disappearing too quickly.

					One of my biggest challenges was balancing visual clarity with the emotions. Making sure the emotions were represented while keeping the visualization required a lot of tweaking. The heatmap effect and fading mechanism needed careful adjustments so that emotions wouldn’t vanish too quickly but still convey a sense of change over time.
					
					
					I was able to create a visualization that captures emotional data in an evolving way. Adding a legend helped provide context, making it clearer which emotions were being represented. However, refining the interactions were frustrating at times, especially when small bugs disrupted the overall effect.
					
					In the end, while the final result doesn’t perfectly match my initial vision, I’m proud of the progress I made.
